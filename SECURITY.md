# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an email to zvonimir.rudinski@noubis.com to notify the Tenantee security team. The security team will work with you to acknowledge receipt of the report and to resolve the vulnerability as quickly as possible.

## Secure Development Process
The Tenantee team takes security seriously and follows the best practices for secure software development. This includes regular code reviews, automated security testing, and security training for all team members.

## Responsible Disclosure
We believe in responsible disclosure and will work with security researchers to resolve any vulnerabilities they discover. We ask that security researchers follow these guidelines when reporting vulnerabilities:

- Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been fixed.
- Do not exploit the vulnerability or use it to cause harm to others.
- Provide enough information to allow the Tenantee security team to reproduce the issue and verify the fix.

We appreciate the efforts of security researchers who help us make Tenantee a more secure platform for everyone.
